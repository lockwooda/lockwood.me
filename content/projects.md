Over the past years, I have been involved in numerous projects.

## Southampton University Cyber Security Society (SUCSS)
I was the president of Southampton University Cyber Security Society (SUCSS) in a caretaker capacity. Being an active participant within SUCSS, I had the privilege of representing University of Southampton at a national level at Inter-ACE 2018, a cyber-security competition hosted by University of Cambridge.

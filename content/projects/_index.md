Over the past year I have been involved in numerous projects in university. Some of these have been placed here for your viewing pleasure.
#### SourceBots
I have been an active volunteer and code base and document base contributor to [SourceBots](https://sourcebots.co.uk/), which is a student-led organisation that creates and hosts robotics competitions for younger individuals.
#### Cyber Security Society (SUCSS)
Being an active participant with in SUCSS over the past year, I had the privilege of representing University of Southampton at a national level at [Inter-ACE 2018](https://inter-ace.org/), a cyber-security competition hosted by University of Cambridge. It was sponsored by international companies such as Facebook and Context, as well as being supported by the National Cyber Security Centre.

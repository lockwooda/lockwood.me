Whilst trying to write this, I was struggling to think about what I should include in my first article on my new website.
Should I be truthful and speak frankly about the reasons behind making this website, or should I try to justify it through other means?

Well, to put it frankly a web presence is a necessity for a computer scientist these days, and by not making one I was effectively in the dark ages.
That obviously is no longer the case. Finally I have a website that would make a much younger version of me very happy, apart from the distinct lack of BBCode.

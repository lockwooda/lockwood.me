I'm Alex Lockwood. I am a second-year Computer Scientist, studying at [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). I have had a keen interest in Computer Science for the majority of my academic life, but have only been pursuing it for the past couple of years.

Primarily my experience lies in procedural object-oriented languages, such as Java, but I also have experience in other languages such as Haskell, C, SQL and [Pawn](https://github.com/compuphase/pawn).
You can find my prior coding work, including some extra-curricular university projects, on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lockwooda/).

Outside of my core academic work, I am involved in numerous student societies at university, including (but not limited to) [LGBT+ Society](https://lgbt.susu.org/) where I am technical officer and [Cyber Security Society](https://www.sucss.org/).
You can find more about what I have done with student societies and other work on the [Projects](../projects/) page.

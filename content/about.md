I'm Alex Lockwood. I am a fourth-year computer scientist, studying at [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/).

Primarily my experience lies in procedural object-oriented languages, such as Java, but I also have experience in other languages such as Pyton, Haskell, C, and SQL.
You can find my prior coding work, including some extra-curricular university projects, on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lockwooda/).

Outside of my core academic work, I am involved in numerous extracurricular activities at university, including (but not limited to) being [the School President of Electronics and Computer Science](https://facebook.com/ECSAP/) and [LGBTQ+ Society](https://www.sotonlgbt.org.uk/) where I am an Ordinary Member on committee.
You can find more about what I have done with student societies and other work on the [Projects](../projects/) page.

I'm Alex Lockwood. I am a fourth-year computer scientist, studying at [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). I have had a keen interest in computer science for the majority of my academic life.

Primarily my experience lies in procedural object-oriented languages, such as Java, but I also have experience in other languages such as Haskell, C, SQL and [Pawn](https://github.com/compuphase/pawn).
You can find my prior coding work, including some extra-curricular university projects, on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lockwooda/).

Outside of my core academic work, I am involved in numerous student societies at university, including (but not limited to) [LGBTQ+ Society](https://www.sotonlgbt.org.uk/) where I am technical officer and [Cyber Security Society](https://www.sucss.org/).
You can find more about what I have done with student societies and other work on the [Projects](../projects/) page.

If you wish to contact me, you can do so through [alex@lockwood.me](mailto:alex@lockwood.me). Furthermore, if you wish to contact me through more secure means you may also use [PGP keys](../pgp/) with me.
